%% The next three sections allow you to load and visualize single unit data from
% The theunissen lab. Your goals are: 1. Get familiar with this data structure and
% 2. Load you own data in a similar structure. 
%  For the Theunissen data you can specify a directory for three brain
%  regions and three example neurons in each.:
%   'mld' is the avian auditory midbrain
%   'ov'  is the avian auditory thalamus
%   'l2a' is the avian auditory cortex
% each region has a 'good', 'avg', and 'bad' dataset,
% corresponding to the signal to noise ratio,
% quantified by information values.
cellDirName = 'mld_good';
cellDir = fullfile(dataDir, cellDirName);


%% now we're going to get the stimulus and response
% files from the cell directory using a function that
% was written to deal with this directory structure.
% we'll will pull stim/response files for conspecific
% stimuli.  You should write your own data load function for your data.

% short time fourier transform, and preprocess the raw spike
% times into PSTHs for each stim/response pair

%% Assignment 1: Calculate the noise for each trial and display it

%% Assignment 3: Is the noise gaussian?


%% Assignment 4: Calculate and display the coherence calculated from the signal to noise
% ratio.


%% We are now going to calculate the coherence and channel capacity using 
% Hsu, Borst, Theunissen methodology.  In order to do that we need
% to take the raw spike times, split them into even and odd trials,
% and compute PSTHs for each half. there's already a function to
% do this, so we'll just call it.
[oddPsths, evenPsths] = compute_psth_halves(srData);

%% the next step is to concatenate the PSTHs across all stim/response
% pairs into one big vector. we're going to do the same thing to 
% the psth halves as well. we're also going to take note of the 
% # of spike trials

  psthHalf2Concat = [psthHalf2Concat evenPsths{k}];

% it with Gaussian noise, pretending it's a PSTH that comes from
% some model

psthConcatNoisy(psthConcatNoisy < 0) = 0; %rectify
psthConcatNoisy(psthConcatNoisy > 1) = 1; %rectify

%% finally, we're going to compute the upper bound of coherence, as
% for the cell itself, as well as the coherence between the noise-
% corrupted PSTH and actual PSTH
