Tutorials for the CRCNS Course
-------------------------------
You have two options for running the tutorial: 

1.  Writing matlab code and running on your laptop. Requires Matlab and some Toolboxes)

2.  Writing python code and running on your laptop. Requires Python and some data analysis packages: see crcns-student/python/getting_started.ipynb

In either case, I suggest getting the entire repository. You can clone the repository by typing: 

git clone https://github.com/theunissenlab/crcns.git 

You will also need to download some data that should be added to the crcns folder you just created by cloning.

You will find the data directory on google drive at:
